# Chlorophyll A and Nitrate Concentrations Throughout Depth in the Western Pacific

Chlorophyll A is used as a tracer for photosynthetic organisms, and Nitrate is a vital nutrient for committing photosynthesis. I analyzed the relationship of Nitrate and Chlorophyll A concentration by depth at two different locations in the West Pacific, which can give insight into primary productivity. I used linear regression to determine the correlation between these two variables.
